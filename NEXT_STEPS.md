# Next Steps for Body Signals

## Overview
Body Signals is a basic health tracking app (MVP). It needs modernization and richer features for production use.

## Upgrades Needed
1. **Database**
   - Replace `signals.json` with a database (e.g., MongoDB, SQLite).
   - Schema: `{ part, observation, condition, details, severity, added }`.

2. **Features**
   - Add edit/delete for signals.
   - Implement search/filter (e.g., by body part).
   - Include health details (e.g., treatment tips, severity levels, external links).

3. **UI**
   - Switch to React or Vue for dynamic frontend.
   - Use Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for modern, responsive design.

4. **Deployment**
   - Host on Vercel or Render with database integration.

## Timeline
- Parked as of April 11, 2025â€”revisit after new project kickoff.
